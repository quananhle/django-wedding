### The "Standard" Wedding Website

The standard wedding website is a responsive, single-page, twitter bootstrap-based site (using a modified version of
[this theme](https://blackrockdigital.github.io/startbootstrap-creative/)).

It is completely customizable to your needs and the content is laid out in standard django templates. By default it includes:

- A "hero" splash screen for a photo
- A mobile-friendly top nav with scrollspy
- A photo/hover navigation pane
- Configurable content sections for every aspect of your site that you want
- A set of different styles you can use for different sections
