                    People have referred to Cory and Rowena as "the greatest couple in the history of time".
                    They have also called them "a power couple the likes of which the world has never before seen".
                    Okay, the people that said those things are Cory and Ro and they may be a little biased.

                    Despite their self-proclaimed greatness, Cory and Ro have a pretty typical story. They met working together.
                    Cory was blown away by Rowena's passion and thirst for adventure.
                    Ro thought Cory was alright looking and a pretty good programmer.
                    It did take years, but somehow he managed to woo her into considering him as a partner, and the rest has been history.
